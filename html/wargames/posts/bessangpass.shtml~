                <h2>Battle Of Bessang Pass - March 1944 - June 1944, Phillipines.</h2>
              <section id="post1-section1">
                <p>There's an oft-overlooked battle in the Pacific theatre of WW2 in the Phillipines called "The Battle Of Bessang Pass" during the Allied liberation of the Phillipines. This battle was something of a tug-of-war between the Filipino Guerillas and the defending Japanese. I'll be using <a href="https://wargameds.com/products/philippines-44">Panzer Campaigns Phillipines '44</a> to illustrate.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The Bessang Pass was part of a defensive line in the mountains off the west coast of Luzon. It led directly from the coast to the mountainous regions, and so was a key point to the integrity of the defensive line.</p>

		<p><a href="https://wargameds.com/products/philippines-44">Phillipines '44</a> covers the 3 major parts of the battle over the 4 month period beginning with:</p>
		<h3>Initial filipino guerilla attack - March 29th 1945</h3>

		<h3>Japanese counter-attack - May 17th 1945</h3>

		<h3>The final push to successfully secure the Bessang Pass - June 10th to June 14th 1945</h3>

                <h2>Plans for this page</h2>
              <section id="post1-section1">
                <p>As someone with what could reasonably called a passing interest in military history and tactics, I find myself drawn to computer-based wargames, both fictional universes, and more real-life ones. Mostly in this blog I'll be focusing on warhammer 40K videogames like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295500/Warhammer_40000_Battlesector/">Warhammer 40k: Battlesector</a>, and the more historical accuracy focused hex-and-counter games from <a href="https://wargameds.com/">Wargame Design Studio</a></p>
		<br>
		<p>So expect this page to have my thoughts on military history and conflicts, wargame reviews, 
new release/patch announcements, and action reports from the (virtual) battlefield!
I'll be including links to seperate pages for each.</p>
