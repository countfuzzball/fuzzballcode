           <h2>Battle Of Bessang Pass - March 1944 - June 1944, Phillipines.</h2>
                <p>There's an oft-overlooked battle in the Pacific theatre of WW2 in the Phillipines called "The Battle Of Bessang Pass" during the Allied liberation of the Phillipines. This battle was something of a tug-of-war between the Filipino Guerillas and the defending Japanese. I'll be using <a href="https://wargameds.com/products/philippines-44">Panzer Campaigns Phillipines '44</a> to illustrate.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The Bessang Pass was part of a defensive line in the mountains off the west coast of Luzon. It led directly from the coast to the mountainous regions, and so was a key point to the integrity of the defensive line.</p>
