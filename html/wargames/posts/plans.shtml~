       <h2>Plans for the wargames section</h2>
              <section id="post1-section1">
                <p>As someone with what could reasonably called a passing interest in military history and tactics, I find myself drawn to computer-based wargames, both fictional universes, and more real-life ones. Mostly in this blog I'll be focusing on warhammer 40K videogames like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295500/Warhammer_40000_Battlesector/">Warhammer 40k: Battlesector</a>, and the more historical accuracy focused hex-and-counter games from <a href="https://wargameds.com/">Wargame Design Studio</a></p>
		<br>
		<p>So expect this part of the site to have my thoughts on military history and conflicts, wargame reviews, 
new release/patch announcements, and action reports from the (virtual) battlefield!
I'll be including links to seperate pages for each.</p>
