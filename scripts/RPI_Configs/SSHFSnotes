To mount a remote ssh host as a filesystem on a local machine:

First of all, we need sshfs on our host computer:

sudo apt-get install sshfs

Then we can create a directory where we mount Pi:

mkdir pi

Then mount the Raspberry Pi`s filesystem to this location:

sshfs pi@192.168.1.3: pi

Now enter this directory as if it is a regular folder; you should be able to see and access the contents of the Raspberry Pi:

cd pi && ls

To safely unmount raspberry directory:

fusermount -u pi


---

To make the remote filesystem follow its local symlinks properly,
i.e make it so a symlink named Storage goes to /mnt:
sshfs -o follow_symlinks pi@192.168.8.115: pi
