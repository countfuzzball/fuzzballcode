VNC's desktop and the local desktop are not necessarily loading the same thing from the
user's POV.

Vnc uses a startup file located in /etc/vnc/xstartup. This can be overwritten
by creating a file called /etc/vnc/xstartup.custom. 

To prevent /etc/alternatives/x-session-manager being called, we can just simply
add our window manager command + startup commands into $HOME/.xsession.
